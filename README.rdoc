= Sunspot Cell (gem)

== Note by Zheileman

* This gem exists because the only gem I could find for the original project (https://github.com/springbok/sunspot_cell) was the one packaged by Kevin Motschiedler (https://github.com/motske/sunspot_cell) and it lacks the support to deal with S3 included in this other fork: https://github.com/chebyte/sunspot_cell


This gem adds Cell support (for indexing rich documents like pdf, docs, html, etc...) to Sunspot (developed against Sunspot 1.3.0).
Support Paperclip and S3 Storage

The code is based on the patch included here:
http://outoftime.lighthouseapp.com/projects/20339/tickets/98-solr-cell

== Requirements

Thanks to Chris Powell, there is now a cook-book style blog post for getting a Rails 3.2 app properly index rich documents using this gem:
http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/indexing-rich-documents-with-rails-sunspot-solr-sunspot-cell-and-carrierwave-cookbook-style/

* Sunspot gem installed (>= 1.3.0)

* Solr Cell libraries (+dist/apache-solr-cell-1.4.X.jar+ and +contrib/extraction/lib/*.jar+ from the standard Solr distribution) placed in the +/solr/lib+ directory as created by the Sunspot gem, in development environment. Your production setup might vary.

* Adjustments to the Solr +schema.xml+:

	<fieldType name="ignored" stored="false" indexed="false" multiValued="true" class="solr.StrField" />
	
and
	
	<dynamicField name="*_attachment" stored="true" type="text" multiValued="true" indexed="true"/>
	<dynamicField name="ignored_*" type="ignored"/>
